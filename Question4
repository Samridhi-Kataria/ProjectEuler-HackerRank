This problem is a programming version of Problem 4 from projecteuler.net

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The smallest 6 digit palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers is 101101 = 143 * 707.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than N.

Solution:-

import sys

    
Palindrom=list()
for i in range(999, 100,-1):
    for j in range(i,100,-1):
        test =int(i*j)
        if (str(test) == str(test)[::-1]):
            Palindrom.append(test)
Palindrom.sort()
t = int(input().strip())
for a0 in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    print(max(x for x in Palindrom if x<n))
