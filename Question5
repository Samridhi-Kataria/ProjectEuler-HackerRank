2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible(divisible with no remainder) by all of the numbers from 1 to N?

Solution:-

import sys


t = int(input().strip())
for a0 in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    num=2
    i=1
    while i<=n:
        if num%i==0:
            i+=1
        else:
            num+=1
            i=1
    print(num)
