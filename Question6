This problem is a programming version of Problem 6 from projecteuler.net

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + … + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + … + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 – 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


Solution:-

import sys


t = int(input().strip())
for a0 in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    
    sum_of_sqr=((n)*(n+1)*(2*n+1))//6
    sqr_of_sum=(n*(n+1)//2)**2
    diff=sqr_of_sum-sum_of_sqr
    print(diff)
