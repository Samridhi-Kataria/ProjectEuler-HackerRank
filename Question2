This problem is a programming version of Problem 2 from projecteuler.net

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
                            1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,....

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


Solution:-

import sys


t = int(input())

for i in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    a, b = 1, 1
    total = 0
    while a <= n:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            total += a
        a, b = b, a+b  
    print (total)
